# Getting Started

Vida allows users to create data visualization dashboards using JSON files. The JSON file works as a specification.

## Run Vida for development

```
yarn rw dev
```

## Run Vida as a standalone dashboard:

```
# viz1.json file should exist in web/public/viz folder
VIZ_JSON=viz1.json yarn rw dev
```
